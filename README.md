## üç∑ How It Works

AISommelier uses the [OpenAI ChatGPT API](https://openai.com/api/) combined with [Vercel Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/features/edge-functions) to deliver fast, context-aware recommendations. Here's how it works:

1. The user provides their taste preferences, food pairings, or wine knowledge level.
2. The app generates a prompt and sends it to the ChatGPT API via an edge function.
3. A personalized wine recommendation and educational breakdown is streamed back to the UI in real-time.

It‚Äôs like having a sommelier in your pocket.
